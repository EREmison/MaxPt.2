This link opens it back on itself. Oh 4/14/13, you crack me up. But I'm not laughing at your expense at all, no, we're in perfect agreement on tho(ugh)ts. I feel full well you have "this urge to be with a [sic] women [sic]." (See, this is tricky to transcribe as the slip could, quite fairly, be attributed to either term.) Error, thy name is ERE. And whatever happens from here on out will have been my fault entirely if I fail to say, now, that I am these "women" you referenced. I am them all. Somehow. Which you'll find that out (ere long, if not already). You'll find that wanting me is wanting what you can't have at all times while simultaneously getting everything sans a moment's hesitation. So please don't dismiss paradox. It's meaningful. It's exactly courageousness.
