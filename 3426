<blockquote>
Not to change the subject 
Or something (as I know
I was just going on
And on about liquids),
But I want to. And "a 
Girl wants what she wants. What
Else can I say [?]," to quote
Your mother. She raised the
Matter of desire. And
She raised you pretty damn
Well, if I might say so.
"I just want somebody
To love," to quote your own
Journal (if I'm meant to
Take it at face value
As genuine letter,
A gesture accurate
Enough to be relied
Upon and replied on).
"Perhaps I just want what
I can't have. Maybe I
Just want something easy,"
To quote you, still. At risk
Of over-citation,
I'll continue in this
Vein (there's the solid as
Opposed to the fluid
Again!). You went on, "Do
I really love her or
Do I just want it her
[Sic] because she was kind,
Beautiful, thoughtful. Do
I just want her to be
Comfortable or just for
The sex, or could it be
Love?" As if (as you know
Now) any amount of
Conjecture amounted
To a fucking thing. Sing.
Single. Singles in my
Fists add up to some three
Hundred dollars a night.
I'm not "kind" in the sense
Of "sort"; sort of girl you
Discount too easy. Nah.
I know the score. I know
You know I'm "beauitful"
Just sporadically.
"What can I say?" You reap
Only exactly what
You sow in this mean life.
I'm not "thoughtful," either,
In the sense you maybe
Meant regarding her (who
Ever "it her" was, to
Labor over your penned
Error for just a sec).
But, in another, more
Strict way, "thoughtful" is all
I am at all. It's the
Only techne I have
Cultivated (if I
Have that, even). Yes, deep
Roller, heavy armor,
Master and other keeps.
The key to writing is
Nothing more than noting
Moments when youre meaning
Is meaning in more than
One way. (Like there, NB:
How I omitted the
Apostrophe so that
The interpretative legs
Of you're/your could be spread
More freely, figuring
My reader's eye would be
Caught by the knee-jerk feel
Of "Oh! There's a typo?") 
Now where was I? Oh, right,
April. Eliot was
Not wrong. It is among
The cruellest month[s], breeding 
Lilacs out of the dead 
Land, mixing memory
And desire, stirring dull 
Roots with spring rain. Waste
Land. Your brokenness. Mine.
Your mind. Mine. Your place or
Mine? Do you really think
You're soliciting my
Opinion in the most 
Generous way? You want
Me to say what I think?
This is far from  "my first
Rodeo," to quote the
Last Maxwell that came to
Pass. Ya sure, you betcha,
I know the right answer.
And if you have to ask,
You can't afford. Comfort.
